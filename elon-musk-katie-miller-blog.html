        <div class="meta">Interview with Katie Miller | Recorded at Elon's Austin Home</div>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>In a wide-ranging conversation from his Austin home—complete with a levitating Tesla Cybertruck in the background—Elon Musk opened up about his DOGE experience, why he'd never do it again, his recurring AI nightmares, and his theory that we're all living in a simulation with exactly one job: keep it interesting enough that whoever's running the show doesn't turn off the computer.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't your typical tech interview. It's personal, philosophical, occasionally hilarious, and deeply revealing about how Musk thinks about everything from government waste to the purpose of consciousness itself.</p>

    <div class="big-idea">
        "Our one job is to keep it interesting so they don't turn the computer off."<br>

        <h2>DOGE: The Made-Up Department That Actually Happened</h2>

        <h3>January 20th: The Roosevelt Room</h3>

        <p>The scene: Elon Musk, sworn in, handed a computer and phone in the Roosevelt Room. His first thought?</p>

        <div class="quote">
            I guess I couldn't believe I was there, for the most part, it's like, it all seemed extremely surreal at the time.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Name Was Born on the Internet</h3>

        <p>DOGE wasn't some carefully planned government initiative with months of strategy sessions. It was crowdsourced:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            DOGE was a made-up name… that had been made up, I don't know, two or three months before… based on internet suggestions. I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, and then someone on the internet said, "No, it should be the Department of Government Efficiency—DOGE." I'm like, "That sounds great." So we just kind of made up a department.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>What DOGE Actually Accomplished</h3>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h4>Major Achievements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">$100-200 billion per year</span> in "zombie payments" stopped</li>
                <li>Required valid payment codes before Treasury sends money</li>
                <li>Fixed payments going out with <span class="highlight">no appropriation code or explanation</span></li>
                <li>Pushed changes into main Treasury system (PAM - Payment Accounts Master)</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">$5 trillion</span> in annual payments now require documentation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="quote">
            Simply requiring a valid payment code and explanation before money goes out stopped most of them. It seems insanely obvious, but roughly 2–3% of government payments really shouldn't be happening—and they're surprisingly hard to kill.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Would He Do It Again?</h3>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Short answer: No.</strong><br>
            "I think instead of doing DOGE, I would've basically... worked on my companies essentially."
        </div>

        <p>When pressed on whether he'd do it again knowing what he knows now:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            They really want the money to keep flowing. So if you stop it from flowing, there's like a very strong reaction to stopping the money flowing... When you cut off the money flowing to political corruption, they lash out hard. Big time.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <strong>DOGE as a side quest:</strong> When asked about his best side quest in life, Musk laughed and said "DOGE. Probably."
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Immigration Reality: "Voter Importation"</h2>

        <p>Musk didn't mince words about what he sees as the biggest government spending issue:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            The single biggest issue is the massive transfer payments going to illegal immigrants. Essentially we're paying people to come here from somewhere else, in huge numbers, including flying them in. You don't need a border wall if you're flying them in, then fast-tracking them to citizenship, making them dependent on government payments, and counting on them to vote hard left. It's basically voter importation.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Money Magnet</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            If you create a gigantic money magnet—"come to America from anywhere and we'll pay you tons of money, give you lots of free stuff"—you're going to get a lot of people taking you up on that offer.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <p>He points to specific examples: Ilhan Omar's Somali community in Minnesota, patterns in California, and local officials elected through similar demographics shifts.</p>

        <p>Bottom line: <em>"Basically, we just don't want to turn the country into a communist hellhole."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>AI Nightmares: What Actually Keeps Elon Up at Night</h2>

        <p>When asked if anything keeps him up at night, Musk's answer was surprisingly candid:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            I wouldn't say there's anything in particular keeping me up at night right now—except that. But if you ask if I wake up having nightmares? Oh, AI. Yeah. Actually... I've had a lot of AI nightmares. I had AI nightmares many nights in a row.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Inevitable Future: Work Becomes Optional</h3>

        <p>Musk is clear about separating prediction from preference:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            I just want to separate what I wish would happen from what I predict will happen, because people get confused about that. They think that what I predict is what I want. What I predict to happen is not the same as what I want to happen. If I could, I would certainly slow down AI and robotics, but I can't. It's advancing at a very rapid pace, whether I like it or not.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Post-Work World</h3>

        <div class="big-idea">
            "Assuming the current trend of artificial intelligence and robotics continues—which seems likely—AI and robots will be able to do anything that humans want them to do, essentially. Work will be optional."
        </div>

        <p>When asked what people would do with unlimited free time, Musk simply says: <em>"People will be able to do whatever they want with their free time."</em></p>

        <h3>Fear Is the Mind Killer</h3>

        <p>On irrational fears:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            I try not to have irrational fears. If I find an irrational fear, I squelch it. Fear is the mind killer.

        <h3>The Context-Switching Problem</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            I have a lot of inbound communication. So… it's information triage. I try to segment the days so that there's not too much context switching because arguably, context switching is difficult... if you had to context switch every 3 seconds or every 30 seconds or every 3 minutes, the context switching cognitive penalty would be very high.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <p>His companies span Tesla, X, xAI, SpaceX, and personal matters—plus random news like "people being burned alive and stuff like that."</p>

        <h3>Can't Go to Target Anymore</h3>

        <p>On doing ordinary things:</p>

        <div class="quote">
            I can't go to things where there's the general public because… there's an immediate "Can I have a selfie?" line that forms. And these days, in particular, in light of Charlie Kirk's murder, there are serious security issues. It's not that I don't want to. I simply can't.

        <h2>Simulation Theory: Our One Job</h2>

        <p>This is where the conversation gets truly fascinating. Musk has a fully developed theory about why simulation theory makes perfect sense—and what it means for humanity:</p>

        <div class="big-idea">
            "The most interesting outcome is the most likely. If simulation theory is accurate that makes perfect sense, because if someone is running a wide range of simulated futures they're going to stop the simulation when it gets boring."
        </div>

        <h3>How SpaceX Tests This Daily</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            When SpaceX or Tesla runs simulations to understand how a car, robot, or spaceship will work, we run thousands of them on the computer. The simulations we actually pay attention to are the most interesting ones. The simulation where everything goes perfectly on the rocket? We don't really look at that; it's fine, but boring... So we hunt for the envelope of flight paths where the rocket can actually make it to orbit without blowing up, we find those boundaries, and then when we launch the real rocket we do everything possible to stay inside them.

        <h3>We're an Alien Netflix Series</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            We could be an alien Netflix series. That series only gets renewed if the ratings stay high. Our one job is to keep it interesting so they don't turn the computer off.
            <div class="quote-author">— Elon Musk</div>
        </div>

        <p>When asked if the ratings are good, Musk simply says: <em>"Yeah."</em></p>

        <h3>Darwinian Selection Applied to Simulations</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            You can even look at it through a Darwinian lens: if you apply natural selection to simulation theory, only the most interesting simulations survive and keep running. Therefore the most interesting outcome is also the most probable one — because the alternative is instant cancellation. So really, humanity has exactly one job: keep it interesting.

            It's not that interesting if everything just blows up. It's over. That's not that interesting. It's not that interesting if there's a calamity that wipes out all the humans. The show just ended. But I mean, fortunately and unfortunately, if there's drama—like war or something like that—that is interesting. You wouldn't go to a movie where everything was just perfect and stayed that way. You'd leave the theater.

            We started as a hydrogen gas cloud that condensed into stars, those stars exploded, the debris re-condensed into new stars, exploded again, and 13.8 billion years later here we are. One fun question is: how many times have your atoms already been at the center of a star? On average it's about three or four. And how many more times will they be? Estimates vary, but it looks like we're roughly halfway through the total lifecycle. So measured by the number of times your atoms will sit in the core of a star, we're about at the midpoint of existence.

            Social media definitely makes people more performative.

Took him like 30 seconds to realize he has just been asked for a cheeseburger because you're not even allowed to ask for soy sauce. So, when he finally recovered, he said, "We don't have cheeseburgers."<br><br>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: A Man Building Multiple Futures</h2>

        <p>What emerges from this conversation is someone acutely aware of multiple simultaneous realities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>political reality</strong> of trying to reform a government that fundamentally resists change</li>
            <li>The <strong>technological reality</strong> of AI advancing whether he likes it or not</li>
            <li>The <strong>existential reality</strong> of humanity needing to become multi-planetary</li>
            <li>The <strong>philosophical reality</strong> that we might all be in a simulation with one job: stay interesting</li>
            <li>The <strong>practical reality</strong> of building rockets, cars, and robots that actually work</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Through it all, Musk maintains a sense of humor about the absurdity—whether it's his son demanding cheeseburgers at a strict sushi restaurant, the fact that Iron Man 2 was filmed at his factory, or the theory that we're all characters in an alien Netflix series that better maintain good ratings.</p>

        <p>Would he do DOGE again? No. Does he have AI nightmares? Yes, many nights in a row. Does he think we're in a simulation? The evidence certainly points that way. Will humanity make it to Mars? If we keep it interesting enough.</p>

        <p>And through all the technology, philosophy, and existential questions, one truth remains constant: cheeseburgers are a genius invention.</p>
